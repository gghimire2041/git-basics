# History of Git

Git, a distributed version control system, was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. It was developed to manage the Linux kernel's source code efficiently and overcome the limitations of existing version control systems.

## Key Milestones:

### 2005: Birth of Git

- **Birth of Git:** Linus Torvalds started developing Git as a replacement for BitKeeper after its free use was revoked for Linux kernel development.
- **Design Philosophy:** Git was designed with a focus on speed, data integrity, distributed development, and strong support for non-linear development.

### 2007: Git 1.5 Release

- **Git 1.5:** Marked a significant release with enhanced performance, features like git-svn for SVN interoperability, and better usability.

### 2008: Git 1.6 and Beyond

- **Git 1.6:** Introduced features such as git-rerere for automatic resolution of reoccurring merge conflicts.
- **Subsequent Releases:** Brought improvements in performance, usability, and collaboration capabilities.

### Present and Future

- **Current State:** Git has become the standard for version control, widely used across industries and open-source projects.
- **Ongoing Development:** Continues to evolve with regular updates, community contributions, and improvements to cater to modern software development needs.

Git's robustness, speed, and flexibility have made it an integral part of software development workflows, empowering developers worldwide to collaborate efficiently and manage version control effectively.


# Git Clone and Git Pull

## `git clone`

The `git clone` command is used to create a local copy of a remote repository.

### Syntax:

```bash
git clone <repository_URL> 
```

## git pull
The `git pull` command is used to fetch and integrate changes from a remote repository into the current branch.
```bash

git pull [<remote>] [<branch>]

# To pull changes from the remote repository into the current branch:
git pull origin main
```
### Usage:
    Fetches the latest changes from the specified remote repository.
    Integrates fetched changes into the current local branch.
    Automatically performs a git fetch followed by a git merge to update the local branch with the remote changes.
